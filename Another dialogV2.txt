D: Did you know resting the batter is the secret to fluffy pancakes?
B: You don’t want to activate the gluten too much so don’t overmix it!
C: By the way, have you tried the savory ones?
A: Savory pancakes? 
C: Yes, I had some with cheese and bacon last week.
A: Aren't they supposed to be sweet.
C: You'd be surprised. Pair them with an egg, and they’re amazing.
A: Hum, I’ll stick with waffles.
B: But pancakes are quicker to make.
D: Quick food? That’s what instant noodles are for.
B: Instant noodles are a lifesaver. I like mine spicy.
A: Not everything needs spice, you know.
D: Agreed. Sometimes you just want comfort food, like mashed potato.
A: Or chicken soup as well.
B: Chicken soup is overrated. I’d rather have a curry with rice.
C: Curry is amazing.
D: True. Grinding your own spices makes a difference.
B: Personally, I use spices I bought from the store.
C: Next time we meet, I’m making my curry for all of you.
D: Deal. But only if I can bring pancakes for dessert.

C: No one's complaining.
D: Besides, we’ll need something sweet after that curry.
B: Speaking of sweet food, has anyone tried making chocolate soufflé?
C: I know those, they’re super fluffy and they jiggle.
A: Aren’t they hard to make?
B: Once you get the egg whites right, the rest is easy.
C: I don’t think I have the patience for that.
D: I tried making soufflé once, but failed.
A: I would have failed as well.
B: Baking is more forgiving than that, like brownies.
A: But double the butter by mistake, and you get chocolate mush.
D: It’s fine until you try to slice it and it just melts.
B: No surpise, cooking takes effort and attention.
A: I like the idea of low effort cooking though.
C: If you want zero effort, just grab some cookies from the store.
D: Cookies are great, but so is homemade bread.
B: I’ve always wanted to bake bread, but the kneading scares me.
C: I can help you with that if you want.
A: You can also cheat with a bread machine.
D: You’ll have to try it next time.
